# Imimot Mitti

This module will allow you to control (Mitti)[https://imimot.com/mitti], a modern, feature-packed but easy-to-use pro video playback solution for live events and exhibitions.

## Requirements

- Mitti with OSC control enabled
- Bitfocus Buttons: v1.8.0 or newer

## Basic Configuration

- In Mitti > Settings... > OSC/UDP Controls, select "Enable"
- In the configuration page for the Mitti module, choose your Mitti from the **Mitti Connection** dropdown. Mitti instances on the network are discovered automatically.
- If your Mitti isn't listed or you wish to manually setup the connection, select **Manual** and enter the IP address of the computer running Mitti in **IP Address**

## Enabling Button Variables & Feedbacks

- In Mitti > Settings... > OSC/UDP Controls, select **Bitfocus-Mitti-Module** from the **Feedback To** dropdown
- If **Bitfocus-Mitti-Module** is not an option, select **Custom** then follow the next steps:
  - For **IP** enter the IP address of the computer running Companion or Buttons
  - For **Port** enter the port number that is present on the configuration page for the Mitti module. By default port `51001` is used
- _Optional: Enable **Feedback Alert** in the module settings. This will show an error when the module does not receive feedback from Mitti. Disable this feature if you do not plan on using the Feedback features._
